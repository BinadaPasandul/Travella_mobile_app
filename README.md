Excited to share a glimpse of Travella, a mobile app I developed with Kotlin! 
Travella is built for travel enthusiasts who love to capture their journeys — it allows users to save travel memories as personal journals and keep all their experiences in one place.
This project gave me the chance to strengthen my skills in Kotlin and Android app development, focusing on clean design and smooth functionality.
I’m looking forward to launching Travella soon and making it a go-to companion for travelers everywhere.
